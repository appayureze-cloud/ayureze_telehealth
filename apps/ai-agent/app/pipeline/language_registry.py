"""Machine-readable language registry (build spec section 25): the single
source of truth for which translation/TTS provider a language pair routes
to, its certification status, and its license-verification status. A pair
cannot be used by TranslationRouter/TTSRouter in production mode until
`Certification.is_certified` AND `LicenseStatus.verified` are both true —
"testing"/"uncertified" pairs fail closed unless a caller explicitly opts
in (e.g. a controlled internal benchmark run).

The default registry below reflects this build's ACTUAL, evidenced state,
not aspiration. **No pair is currently marked `certified`.** en<->ta was
previously certified against NLLB-200/MMS-TTS's real output (the 75-case
safety corpus, a live end-to-end integration test, a measured latency
benchmark), but this build's own license audit found both models
CC-BY-NC-4.0 (non-commercial) — see docs/MODEL_LICENSE_MATRIX.md.

en<->ta/ta<->en/en<->ml now offer TWO translation routes, matching
app/config.py's deploy-time-selectable ai_translation_backend — neither
removes the other from the codebase:
  primary:  `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-dra`/`opus-mt-dra-en` — Apache-2.0
            AND genuinely CPU-feasible (a real CPU-only VPS is this
            build's actual current deployment target). This is what
            actually runs today.
  fallback: `madlad400-3b` — Apache-2.0 but GPU-only per its own docs;
            the path once real GPU infrastructure exists.
TTS is `None`/captions-only by default with `qwen3-tts` as the fallback
for the same reason (GPU + a reference voice per language, neither
available today) — no TTS candidate is currently both commercially
licensed and CPU-feasible (k2-fsa/OmniVoice's pretrained weights are
CC-BY-NC despite an Apache-2.0 codebase; Piper TTS's Tamil voice license
is unverified/mixed per-voice) — see `docs/MODEL_LICENSE_MATRIX.md`.

Certification was reset to `testing` rather than carried over when the
primary route changed from NLLB-200 to OPUS-MT: the prior evidence was
against a DIFFERENT model's actual translations and does not transfer
without re-running the same regression evidence against the new one.
Every other entry (de->en, ja->en) exists to demonstrate the
registry/router mechanism the build spec asks for and is likewise
`testing`/`uncertified` until it
earns that status with real evidence.
